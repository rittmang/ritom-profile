  about: |
    I've always believed in creating technology to better everyone's lives - as a student, and as a working professional.

    Besides developing at GrowthX, I also built my own Netflix just to watch the content I like. Because no platform solves that for me, not even Netflix.

    ðŸŸ© Typical question I'm asked: "Which languages and frameworks do you know?"
    My interview response: "So there's Python, Java, Node..."
    What I mean: "Give me anything with sane documentation and a help forum, I'll get it done."

    What do I do everyday?

    ðŸ’» Get a feature running on any project.
    Yes it's a pain, but I like to challenge myself to do it.

    ðŸ“• Read books. 
    Fiction usually. I don't find great value in self-help books.

    ðŸŽ¶ Listen to my favourite tracks on loop. 
    It's insanely comforting. Only when I can give full attention, do I explore other genres.
